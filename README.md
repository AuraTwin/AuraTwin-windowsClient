# AuraTwin Windows Client 💻

Official desktop application for **AuraTwin** - An Affective Digital Twin for Personalized Well-being and Self-Correction.

This repository contains the "sensor" component of the system: a lightweight Python application that runs in the background to capture and process emotional data securely.

## 📖 About

This is the Windows Client repository for our graduation project at **Yaşar University**, Computer Engineering Department. The application is designed to monitor user well-being without intruding on daily tasks. It utilizes "Capture & Release" technology to ensure privacy while providing high-frequency data for the digital twin.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Python** - Core application logic
* **OpenCV (cv2)** - Camera access and image processing
* **PyQt5** - Modern GUI and System Tray integration
* **Requests** - Secure communication with AWS Backend
* **Base64** - In-memory image encoding (Privacy-first)

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔒 **Privacy-First Architecture:** Images are never saved to the hard drive. They are processed entirely in RAM and sent directly to the server.
* ☁️ **Edge Processing:** Converts images to Base64 strings for secure transmission.
* 🤫 **Background Mode:** Runs silently in the System Tray (near the clock).
* ⚡ **Smart Collision Detection:** Automatically skips cycles if the camera is being used by other apps (Zoom, Meet, etc.).
* 🔑 **Token-Based Authentication:** Securely links the desktop app with the user's web dashboard.
